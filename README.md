## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze historical sales data to uncover key insights into business performance.

The dashboard features a clean, dark-mode user interface, which was prototyped and designed in **Figma** to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. Advanced calculations, custom measures, and key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to provide deep, actionable insights.
